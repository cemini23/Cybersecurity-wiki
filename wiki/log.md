## [2026-05-12] scaffold | Workspace bootstrapped from SEO wiki-template

- Forked `wiki-template/` to `~/Desktop/projects/Cybersecurity wiki/`
- Adapted `CLAUDE.md` for cybersecurity-vertical scope: offensive security + defensive operations + career/education
- Created entity subfolders: certifications, tools, frameworks, threat-actors, platforms, people, vendors, programming-languages
- Wrote README, ROADMAP, LESSONS, LICENSE, hot.md
- Added `Related Wikis` table linking `osint-wiki`, `image-gen-wiki`, `seo-wiki`, `3d-printing-wiki`
- Added cybersecurity-specific `Hands-on rules — ethics + legality` block (authorization, responsible disclosure, dual-use tools, kid-safety framing)

## [2026-05-12] ingest | Joas A Santos cybersecurity PDF corpus (227 PDFs)

- **Source**: shared Google Drive folder `ebooks Joas` (folder ID `12Mvq6kE2HJDwN2CZhEGWizyWt87YunkU`, owner joasantonio108@gmail.com)

- **Method**: Drive API `parentId` query returned empty for shared folders, so contents were enumerated via Playwright DOM scrape (`[data-id]` attributes + tooltip-derived titles). Full inventory persisted to `.scratch/drive_inventory.tsv`
- **Pages touched** — 50+ entities/concepts + 226 source stubs:
  - **226 source stubs** generated via `scripts/build_source_stubs.py` (frontmatter + Drive file-ID provenance + read_status=unread-stub)
  - **2 validated frameworks**: MITRE ATT&CK (full deep-read from `Mitre Att&ck Study Overview.pdf`), Cyber Kill Chain (Unified Cyber Kill Chain content from `Red Team Operations – Concepts #1.pdf`)
  - **8 tool entities**: Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Caldera, Maltego, Wazuh, Nmap, BloodHound
  - **10 certification entities**: OSCP, OSWA, OSWE, CRTO, CEH, CompTIA Security+/PenTest+, eCPPT/eCPTX/eWPT
  - **5 vendor entities**: Offensive Security, eLearnSecurity, CompTIA, EC-Council, Zero-Point Security
  - **1 platform**: HackTheBox
  - **1 person**: Joas A Santos (anchor for the entire source corpus)
  - **1 threat actor**: APT28 (only named APT in the corpus)
  - **4 programming language entities**: Python, C/C++, JavaScript, PowerShell — all security-focused
  - **5 validated concepts**: Red Team Operations, Adversary Emulation, AV/EDR Bypass, Web Pentest Methodology, OSINT for Cybersecurity
  - **20+ draft concepts**: SOC Operations, Incident Response, Threat Hunting, Malware Analysis, Exploit Development, Cyber for Kids, Social Engineering, Windows Pentest, Privilege Escalation, Cloud Pentest, Mobile Pentest, Network Security, Container Security, Bug Bounty, Responsible Disclosure, Cybersecurity Careers, Anonymity Networks, Cyberwarfare, AI for Cybersecurity, Blockchain Security, Metaverse Security, Game Hacking, Zero Trust, Purple Team Operations
- **Deep-reads (anchor pages)**: 4 PDFs fully ingested:
  1. `Mitre Att&ck Study Overview.pdf` → @entities/frameworks/mitre-attack.md
  2. `Red Team Operations – Concepts #1.pdf` → @concepts/red-team-operations.md + @entities/frameworks/cyber-kill-chain.md + @concepts/adversary-emulation.md
  3. `AV and EDR Bypass Techniques for new Hackers - Update 2022.pdf` → @concepts/av-edr-bypass.md
  4. `Web PenTesting Checklist by Joas.pdf` → @concepts/web-pentest-methodology.md
- **Cross-wiki backlinks** added: web-pentest-methodology references `@seo-wiki/concepts/web-vitals.md`; osint-for-cybersecurity references `@osint-wiki/concepts/typed-relation-dependencies.md`
- **Read status**: 4 sources `deep-read`, 222 sources `unread-stub` (titles + provenance only; deep-read deferred to future sessions per the ROADMAP)
- **Maturity at write time**: 8 pages `validated` (5 concept + 2 framework + 1 person), 47 pages `draft` (will mature with future ingests + corpus deep-reads)
